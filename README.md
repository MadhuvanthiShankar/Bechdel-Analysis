**Analysing Gender Equality in Hollywood Movies using the Bechdel Test**

  Hollywood has long been criticized for its gender imbalance, with female representation often underrepresented both in front of and behind the camera. This disparity has sparked movements to assess and address gender equality in the industry. The Bechdel Test, introduced by Alison Bechdel, offers a straightforward metric for evaluating a film's portrayal of women by requiring at least two named female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. 
  
  However, this test alone does not suffice to draw definitive conclusions, which is why this project includes a correlational analysis to explore whether increased female involvement in the cast and crew has any impact on box office performance. This project analyzes gender equality in Hollywood movies using the Bechdel Test, focusing on films released from 2010 to 2024. The analysis leverages datasets from the Bechdel Test API, TMDb 5000 Movies, and TMDb 5000 Credits, combined with financial data to assess the impact of female representation in film. Using advanced Python libraries such as Seaborn and Plotnine, the project visualizes key trends and insights regarding gender balance in the industry.

**Key features:**

- Data analysis on gender representation in movie casts and crews
- Bechdel Test score assessment
- Impact of female involvement on box office performance
- Visualizations using Python for insightful data presentation
